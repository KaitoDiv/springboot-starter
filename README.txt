This code sets up a basic project structure using SpringBoot, Restful, MyBatis, and MariaDB.It includes controllers, services, mappers, and DAOs for the basic CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations on the Member entity.The CRUD operations for the Member entity are implemented and ready to use:	•	CREATE (INSERT)	•	READ (GET)	•	UPDATE (UPDATE)	•	DELETE (DELETE)This project can be used by those who are studying SpringBoot or need to set up a simple server.Additionally, for the queries:	•	Use “i_mb_email” for the member email in the INSERT statement.	•	Use “w_mb_email” for the member email in the WHERE clause.	•	Use “u_mb_email” for the member email in the UPDATE statement.Database connection properties:  driver-class-name: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver  url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/tmplDB  username: root  password: password123If you want to connect to the database, it is recommended to run MariaDB in a Docker container.Thank you, I hope this helps!
